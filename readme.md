## Overview

BackItems uses the  and the [Curios API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/curios) to add a new Back slot to the player inventory, along with several items to go be used in the slot.

## Items
#### Backpack
A simple backpack with 9 slots, upgradeable 3 times with the Storage enchantment up to a total of 36.

#### Quiver
Holds up to 5 stacks of arrows, and when worn shows an overlay similar to the hotbar across the top of the screen. You can change the selection with the action key (default 'R'), and when firing a bow if the offhand is the selected arrow will be used from the quiver instead of from your inventory. 

#### Parachute
While falling (more than 3 blocks) press jump again to open your equipped parachute. If opened early enough it will slow your fall and save your life. The Perpetual parachute will stop it from breaking as well!

#### Glider
Using the [Caelus API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/caelus), adds a single use glider that functions the same as elytra and can be repaired at and anvil with leather.
